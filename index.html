      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This project focuses on migrating the Adaptive Learning Codebase from the legacy Autogen framework 
        to CrewAI. The goal is to modernize the system by replacing existing agents with CrewAI equivalents, 
        ensuring improved scalability, maintainability, and extensibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        The migration process includes analyzing current Autogen agents, mapping their roles to CrewAI 
        task-agent models, and implementing workflows for math, language, and career path learning. 
        Comprehensive testing and validation are performed to benchmark CrewAI agent performance against 
        the legacy system. Finally, updated documentation and a detailed migration guide are provided to 
        support future development and onboarding.
